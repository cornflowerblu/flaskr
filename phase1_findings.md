# Phase 1 Findings: Environment Investigation

## Package Versions

| Package | Initial Version | Compatible Version |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Flask   | 2.3.0          | 2.3.0 (unchanged) |
| Werkzeug| 3.1.3          | 2.3.0 (downgraded)|
| Python  | 3.12.3         | 3.12.3 (unchanged)|
| pytest  | 8.3.5          | 8.3.5 (unchanged) |

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified as a version incompatibility between Flask 2.3.0 and Werkzeug 3.1.3. The specific problem:

1. Flask 2.3.0 expects Werkzeug to have a `__version__` attribute
2. Werkzeug 3.1.3 removed this attribute
3. This caused the error: `AttributeError: module 'werkzeug' has no attribute '__version__'`

## Resolution

We downgraded Werkzeug from version 3.1.3 to 2.3.0, which is compatible with Flask 2.3.0. This resolved the issue by ensuring that the `__version__` attribute is available.

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- 8 tests collected
- 4 tests passing (50%)
- 4 tests failing (50%)
- Test coverage: 58% (27 of 65 statements not covered)

### After Fix
- 10 tests collected (2 additional tests were discovered)
- 10 tests passing (100%)
- 0 tests failing (0%)
- Test coverage: 81% (14 of 74 statements not covered)

## Dependencies Updated

The `requirements.txt` file has been updated to pin the specific compatible versions:
```
Flask==2.3.0
Werkzeug==2.3.0
pytest
pytest-cov
```

## Observations

1. The test suite now runs successfully with all tests passing
2. Test coverage improved from 58% to 81%
3. There are some deprecation warnings in the Werkzeug package related to Python 3.14 compatibility
4. The number of statements in the codebase appears to have increased from 65 to 74, likely due to previously untested code now being included in the coverage report

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding tests for the remaining 14 uncovered statements to reach higher coverage
2. Document the version constraints in project documentation
3. Consider setting up a CI pipeline to ensure compatibility is maintained in future updates
