# Flaskr: A Simple Flask-based Blog Application

Flaskr is a lightweight, Flask-powered blog application designed to demonstrate the core features of the Flask web framework.
It provides a simple yet functional platform for users to create, view, and manage blog entries.

This application serves as an excellent starting point for developers looking to understand Flask's architecture and basic web development concepts.
Flaskr showcases user authentication, database interactions, and templating, making it an ideal learning tool for Flask beginners.

- `setup.cfg`: Configuration file for pytest alias
- `setup.py`: Package and distribution configuration

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Getting Started

1. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python manage.py init_db
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```
   python manage.py run
   ```
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these in a `.env` file in the project root:

```
FLASK_APP=flaskr
FLASK_DEBUG=true
```

### Common Use Cases

1. Viewing blog entries:
   - Navigate to the home page to see all entries.

2. Adding a new entry:
   - Log in to the application.
   - Use the form at the top of the page to add a new entry.

3. User authentication:
   - Click the "log in" link in the top right corner.
   - Enter your credentials to log in.

### Testing

To run the test suite:

```
python setup.py test
```

### Troubleshooting

1. Database initialization fails:
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the application directory.
   - Check if the database file already exists and remove it if necessary.

2. Application fails to start:
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly.
   - Check the console output for specific error messages.

3. Login issues:
   - Ensure the database is properly initialized with user credentials.
   - Check for any error messages on the login page.

### Debugging

To enable debug mode, set the `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable to `true`:

```
export FLASK_DEBUG=true
```

Debug logs can be found in the console output when running the application.

## Data Flow

The Flaskr application follows a simple request-response cycle:

1. User sends a request to a specific URL.
2. Flask routes the request to the appropriate view function.
3. The view function interacts with the SQLite database if necessary.
4. The view renders a template, populating it with data.
5. The rendered HTML is sent back as a response to the user.

```
[User] -> [Request] -> [Flask Router] -> [View Function]
                                              |
                                              v
[User] <- [Response] <- [Rendered Template] <- [Database]
```

Key technical considerations:
- SQLite is used as the database, which is suitable for small-scale applications.
- Jinja2 is used for templating, allowing for dynamic content generation.
- User sessions are managed using Flask's built-in session handling.
